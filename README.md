## Abstract

This paper presents a shared responsibility model underpinned by the cyber security mesh architecture framework, leveraging decentralized security controls, distributed identity management, and federated threat intelligence to eliminate security silos. By enabling context-aware, adaptive, and collaborative cybersecurity, this approach ensures resilient, scalable, and policy-driven protection tailored to the unique threat landscape of the electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
